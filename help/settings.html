<div style="width: 600px;">

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
  The various settings are configured with individual macros which help to
  ensure given values will work and are correct. Properties defined with
  <small>[S]</small> mean that they are nullable by passing "0" as an
  argument.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><i>string</i></dt>
  <dd>
    Values are passed through strip_attr() and leading/trailing white space is
    removed. Some strings have the /grab property set so typing the macro with
    no arguments will essentially allow you to modify them. To clear these
    properties you need to pass "0" to the macro.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><i>boolean</i></dt>
  <dd>
    Values are evaluated as either true(1) or false(0). Giving no arguments to
    the macro will cause the value to toggle. Strings are generally evaluated as
    false unless they begin with a non-zero number.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><i>integer</i></dt>
  <dd>
    Values are passed through abs() and trunc() before saving.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><i>float</i></dt>
  <dd>
    Values are passed through abs() and round() where they are saved only to
    the hundredth place.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><i>time</i></dt>
  <dd>
    Values are passed through abs() and trunc() (similar to how integers are
    handled) before saving, but are displayed through to_dhms() which formats
    the time into days, hours, minutes and seconds.
  </dd>
</dl>
