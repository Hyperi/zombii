<h2>Run Macros</h2>

<h3>Config Reference</h3>

<p>The Zombii run macros are very unique in that they are actually Python
scripts. These scripts have a global variable called <em>FILE</em> which is a
list of movements (dictionary) which contain all of the information about a
particular loop. Runs are saved to the <em>runs</em> directory.</p>

<p>The format of this movement dictionary is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
FILE = [
  {
    'alignment': str,
    'announce': str,
    'commands': str,
    'flags': str,
    'in': str,
    'items': str,
    'name': str,
    'out': str,
    'path': str,
    'skip': str,
    'target': str,
    'warnings': str,
  },
  ],
</pre>
</blockquote>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a name="alignment" href="#alignment">alignment</a>
    <i>str</i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Alignment of the target in this room. This is announced along with the
    targets as you enter the room. In the <em>runs</em> directory there
    is an <em>align</em> module which defines all of the possible alignments.
    To use this just add <code>from align import *</code> to the top of your
    run and then you will have access to the globals defined there.
    <br/>
    <b>Example:</b> <code>DEMONIC</code> (if you are using the <em>align</em> module)
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a name="announce" href="#announce">announce</a>
    <i>str</i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Announcement to be broadcasted after executing the
    <a href="#path">path</a>. This is useful for stating that you are. This is
    also useful for the <em>scripts/dump.py</em> script which looks at this
    announce to calculate <a href="#skip">skips</a>.
    <br/>
    <b>Example:</b> <code>'Central Square'</code> or <code>'Cyndre 3.5m'</code>.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a name="commands" href="#commands">commands</a>
    <i>str</i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Commands (separated by a semi-colon) that should be executed by party
    members. These are used in situations where the party doesn't follow, like
    in Varalors or getting to Kiord.
    <br/>
    <b>Example:</b> <code>'push plate;2 n'</code>
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a name="flags" href="#flags">flags</a>
    <i>str</i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Flags are attributes about the current room represented by a single symbol.
    They are not really used but are announced along with the
    <a href="#announce">announce</a>. Common flags include <em>outside</em>
    (O), <em>banishes</em> (B) and <em>areas</em> (A).
    <br/>
    <b>Example:</b> <code>'AB'</code> (casts areas and banishes)
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a name="in" href="#in">in</a>
    <i>str</i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Commands (separated by a semi-colon) that you would type in order to return
    to this room after having executed <em>/out</em> (which executes the
    commands defined in <a href="#out">out</a>). This allow you to type
    <em>/in</em> without any arguments.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a name="items" href="#items">items</a>
    <i>str</i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Items that are required in order to execute the
    <a href="#commands">commands</a>. These items can be keys, or a flute, or
    anything that's required in order to execute those commands. If you have a
    <em>bag of holding</em> these items will be fetched from it. It should be
    noted that you can specify multiple items. See <em>help handling</em> on
    the mud.
    <br/>
    <b>Example:</b> <code>"cell key"</code> (for the Prizon)
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a name="name" href="#name">name</a>
    <i>str</i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Name of the current room which is to be used in the previous room's
    announcement. If defined, the previous room will note that this room is
    next. The special value <em>__announce__</em> is used if you wish the name
    to be automatically generated from the <a href="#announce">announce</a>.
    <br/>
    <b>Example:</b> <code>"Ravenloft (to CS)"</code> or <code>"__announce__"</code>
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a name="out" href="#out">out</a>
    <i></i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Commands (separated by a semi-colon) that you would type in order to safely
    wimpy from this room. This allows you to type <em>/out</em> without any
    arguments. To return to the original room you should execute <em>/in</em>
    (uses commands defined in <a href="#in">in</a>).
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a name="path" href="#path">path</a>
    <i>str</i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Commands (separated by a semi-colon) that should be executed when
    performing this movement. This is the heart and soul of run macros.
    <br/>
    <b>Example:</b> <code>"3 n;2 w;s;u"</code> (CS to Plaque)
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a name="skip" href="#skip">skip</a>
    <i>int</i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The number of rooms you'd have to skip in order to get back to the current
    position. If you make a stop at the beginning of an area which 5 rooms you'd
    set the skip to be 5 which will then allow you to type <em>/skip</em>. It's
    assumed that you also stop at the same location after the area is
    completed. This essentially fast forwards the run without actually
    executing any of the commands. Skips are displayed along with
    <a href="#announce">announces</a>.
    <br/>
    <b>Example:</b> <code>5</code> (would skip the next 5 rooms)
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a name="target" href="#target">target</a>
    <i>str</i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The target that lives in the current room. This sets the <em>%{target}</em>
    variable and allows you to use macros such as <em>/k</em> or <em>/ks</em>.
    The target is also announced to the party so that other members can set it
    too.
    <br/>
    <b>Example:</b> <code>'cyndre'</code>
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a name="warnings" href="#warnings">warnings</a>
    <i>str</i>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Warnings about the current room which should be observed. Warnings may
    include spells that the target may cast, or other things to be careful
    about. The warnings are announced to the party.
    <br/>
    <b>Example:</b> <code>"Casts 'psychic crush' and 'banishes'"</code>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Loading ane Executing</h3>

<p>To load a run you use the <em>/load_run [filename]</em> command and specify
the filename you wish the load. The filename does not include the extension.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
/load_run cash
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>After loading the run you can execute it with the <em>/nr</em> (F4) command.</p>
