<h2>Combat</h2>

<h3>Attacks</h3>

<p>Setting up attack skills/spells are done with the <em>/attack_method</em>
and the related <em>/attack_skill</em>, <em>/attack_spell</em> commands. First
decide if your main attack method is <em>use</em> or <em>cast</em>. Next set
your attack skill/spell using the appropriate commands. There are also
<em>/start_attack_skill</em> and <em>/start_attack_spell</em> commands. For
example, if you were a Monk you might set the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
/attack_method use
/attack_skill kungfu
/start_attack_skill ki
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You can then use the <em>/k</em> (which uses the skill/spell), <em>/kk</em>
(same as /k but also uses the <em>kill</em> command against the target),
<em>/ka</em> (same as /kk but uses <em>kill all</em> command) and <em>/ks</em>
(similar to /k except uses the start attack skill/spell). You may also be
interested in checking out <em>/do_kill</em>.</p>

<h3>Heals</h3>

<p>Setting up heal skills/spells are done with the <em>/heal_method</em> and
the related <em>/heal_skill</em>, <em>/heal_spell</em> commands. First decide
if your main heal method is <em>use</em> or <em>cast</em>. Next set your heal
skill/spell using the appropriate commands. The heal macros are set up to make
use of chains. When you heal a new target the <em>_healing</em> alias will be
updated. For example, if you were a Cleric you might set the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
/heal_method cast
/heal_spell half heal
chain half heal:half heal:_healing
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You can then use the <em>/h</em> (which uses the skill/spell). You may also
be interested in checking out <em>/do_heal</em>.</p>

<h3>Looting and Corpses</h3>

<p>The overall corpse setting is <em>/on_kill</em>. All of the various
corpse/loot trigs will check the value of <em>on_kill</em> before checking
their individual settings.</p>

<p>The <em>/on_kill_corpse</em> command will take any of the following
arguments: leave, eat, tin, dig, carriage, get and stuff. Some of the commands
require items in order to work properly, such as a tinning kit or shovel.</p>

<p>The <em>/on_kill_loot</em> command is a boolean which will enable/disable
looting of corpses. It uses the mud's <em>autoloot</em> setting as well as
using <em>loot</em> as a backup.</p>

<p>The <em>/on_kill_give_to</em> command defines a target which should receive
your loot. This could be another player, a pet, a mule, etc.</p>

<p>The <em>/on_looted</em> command works of a different message. It will
attempt to activate the <em>/loot</em> macro after somebody else loots. This
helps to avoid possible issues with looting before somebody who has dibs on the
body.</p>
