<h2>Effects</h2>

<p>To check which effects you currently have on type <em>/cpo</em>. If you wish
to only see a shorter list of effects you can set that list with the
<em>/cpl_prots</em> comand. The prots need to be standardized by replacing
spaces with underscores and removing any non-alphanumeric characters. Once you
have your <em>/cpl_prots</em> set you can use the <em>/cpl</em> (shows a
complete list of all prots, online and offline) and <em>/cpm</em> (shows only
the missing prots) commands.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
/cpl_prots lesser greater iron_will unpain
/cpl
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If you wish to report your effects to the party you can append _p to the
various effect checking commands. Party members can request your active prots
by whispering 'prots' or 'proots' to you.</p>
