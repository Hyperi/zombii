<h1>Effects</h1>

<p>To check which effects you currently have on type
<em>/check_effects_online</em>. If you wish to only see a shorter list of
effects you can set that list with the <em>/effects_list</em> comand. The
effects need to be standardized by replacing spaces with underscores and
removing any non-alphanumeric characters. Once you have your
<em>/effects_list</em> set you can use the <em>/check_effects</em> (shows a
complete list of all effects, online and offline) and
<em>/check_effects_missing</em> (shows only the missing effects) commands.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
/effects_list lesser greater iron_will unpain
/check_effects
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If you wish to report your effects to the party you can append _p to the
various effect checking commands. Party members can request your active effects
by whispering 'prots' or 'proots' to you.</p>
